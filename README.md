# PixelWorldsProxy
PixelWorldsProxy made in C#. 

Useful for capturing packets and hacking (if u know how to code). 

This project was started 2019 but not open src until now. 

I have only updated PW server IP and removed few lines of unnecessary code...

This proxy is a bit buggy because I haven't updated it since then, so you might need to restart the proxy if you ever get stuck with it.
